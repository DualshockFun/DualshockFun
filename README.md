Usage
-------------
**RUN START.BAT**

Troubleshooting
-------------
If your controller is vibrating stop and start then try closing and reopening the start.bat

If your controller is vibrating but then randomly stopping try not to input stuff (use mouse and keyboard) while *using* it, obviously can watch *stuff* and keep things open.

These are the only issues I've come across *using* it if theres any other issues just open a issue on this repository.
